# Linear-Model-Simulator
This web application allows users to upload their own datasets, select one of four regression models (linear, lasso, ridge, or elasticnet), and compare the results of each model. The application has a separate webpage where users can check the correlation between variables in their dataset and another webpage for drawing graphs for columns in their dataframe.

The application was built using Streamlit, Flask, and several libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

Users can upload their dataset in CSV format and select the regression model they want to use for analysis. The application then processes the dataset and displays the results in an easy-to-understand format, including graphs and tables that show the accuracy and performance of each model.

The correlation checker webpage allows users to visualize the correlation between variables in their dataset and identify any patterns or relationships between them. Users can select the variables they want to analyze, and the web application generates a correlation matrix.

The graphing webpage allows users to select the columns they want to plot and choose from a variety of graph types.
