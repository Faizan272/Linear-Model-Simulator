# Linear-Model-Simulator
This web application allows users to upload their own datasets, select one of four regression models (linear, lasso, ridge, or elasticnet), and compare the results of each model. The application has a separate webpage where users can check the correlation between variables in their dataset and another webpage for drawing graphs for columns in their dataframe.

The application was built using Python, Flask, and several libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib. The front-end was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed on a cloud-based platform.

Users can upload their dataset in CSV format and select the regression model they want to use for analysis. The application then processes the dataset and displays the results in an easy-to-understand format, including graphs and tables that show the accuracy and performance of each model.

The correlation checker webpage allows users to visualize the correlation between variables in their dataset and identify any patterns or relationships between them. Users can select the variables they want to analyze, and the web application generates a correlation matrix and a heatmap.

The graphing webpage allows users to select the columns they want to plot and choose from a variety of graph types, including bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots. The graphs are interactive and can be customized with labels, titles, and colors.

Overall, this web application provides a powerful tool for users to analyze and visualize their datasets, compare regression models, and gain insights into the relationships between variables. It showcases my skills in web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
